# Raula

Raula is a typesafe routing library for the React. You can choose a destination from intellisense of vscode with no code generation.

## Motivation

There are already several awesome routing libraries for the React such as React Router, Expo Router and Tanstack Router. All of them has great features and allows you to manage routing.

But, I think no one uses full-power TypeScript inference like tRPC so I created this library.


## Example

You can try example project on the browser with StackBlitz.
